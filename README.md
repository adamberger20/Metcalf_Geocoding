# Metcalf_Geocoding

This repo contains data on bus burnings in Sao Paulo, Brazil and a script to query the Google Maps API and geocode (i.e. convert to latitude and longitude) those addresses. This repo will be updated as necessary to manage further tasks on this project. It contains two important folders:

1. __data__: Data on the bus burnings and outputs from geocoding.

1. __scripts__: Script used to geocode the addresses for the bus burnings.

Running those scripts requires two packages:

```
library(tidyverse)
library(mapsapi)
```
